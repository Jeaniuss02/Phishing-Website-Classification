# Phishing-Website-Classification
Given the phishing website dataset, we are going to classify the phishing website from the UCI  Machine Learning repository (Mohammad, 2015). The objective of this experiment is to classify  the Phishing Website dataset by building different machine learning algorithms (Perceptron,  Decision tree, Neural network, Naïve bayes and KNN).

### Introduction
Given the phishing website dataset, we are going to classify the phishing website from the UCI 
Machine Learning repository (Mohammad, 2015). The objective of this experiment is to classify 
the Phishing Website dataset by building different machine learning algorithms (Perceptron, 
Decision tree, Neural network, Naïve bayes and KNN). 

### Data Description
Data source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/327/phishing+websites. This dataset contains 31
columns (30 features and 1 target variable) and 11055 rows of integer type data which are 
assigned “-1”, “0”, “1”, where according to the data description, “1” means legitimate, “0” is 
suspicious and “-1” is phishing. It is used to train and evaluate machine learning models, such as 
classifying the detection of phishing websites. In addition, some new features were proposed, 
experimentally assign new rules to some well-known features, and update some other features, 
such as Address Bar based Features like “Using the IP address”, “Long URL”, etc., HTML and 
JavaScript based features, Domain based features as well as Abnormal base features.
